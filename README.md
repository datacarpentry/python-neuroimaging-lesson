Lessons on neuroimaging analysis with Python

## Instructions

To run these notebooks, you will need to install the
[`IPython`](http://ipython.org) software, and a few other scientific libraries.
One way to install these is by using the (free) Anaconda software distribution:

- Go to the [Anaconda website](http://continuum.io/downloads) and follow the
  instructions therein to download and install the distribution for your
  platform.

You will also need the [`nibabel`](http://nipy.org/nibabel) library:

- To install `nibabel` in a terminal command line execute:

        pip install nibabel

Once you have followed these instructions, you should have all the software
needed installed on your computer. To start running the notebooks, change the
working directory of your terminal to the directory where you have downloaded
the notebook files (using `cd`) and type:

    ipython notebook

A browser window should open with a list of notebook files. Start by reading
the `index` notebook and follow the instructions from there.
